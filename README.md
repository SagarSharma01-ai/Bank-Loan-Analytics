## 1. Project Objective
This project analyzes a bank's lending portfolio comprising **38,576 loan applications** funded at **$435.8 Million**. The goal was to assess the financial health of the bank, distinguish between "Good" and "Bad" loans, and identify key risk factors.

---

## 2. Tools Used (Full Stack Approach)
- **SQL:** Validated data integrity and calculated core KPIs (Good/Bad Loan %, Funded vs. Received Amount).
- **Microsoft Excel:** Built a quick-view summary dashboard for operational monitoring.
- **Power BI:** Created an interactive executive dashboard with filters for Grade, State, and Purpose.
- **Python:** Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand correlations.
